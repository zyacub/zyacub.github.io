# Global Temperature Trends Visualization

This project is an interactive visualization of global temperature trends over time, using data from NASA's Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index.

## Overview

The visualization takes users through a narrative of global warming, presenting different views of temperature anomaly data from 1880 to the present. It includes:

1. An introduction with an overview of temperature changes
2. A detailed timeline of temperature anomalies
3. A comparison of temperature changes by decade
4. A view comparing different time periods
5. A conclusion summarizing key findings

## Features

- Interactive D3.js visualizations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Step-by-step narrative structure
- Ability to zoom into specific time periods
- Tooltips for detailed data points

## Technical Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- D3.js for data visualization
- CSV data parsing

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the visualization
- `script.js`: Main JavaScript file containing visualization logic
- `GLB.Ts+dSST.csv`: Dataset file with global temperature anomalies

## Data Source

The data used in this visualization comes from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4). The dataset, `GLB.Ts+dSST.csv`, contains global temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present.

## Features in Detail

1. **Introduction**: Overview of global temperature changes since 1880.
2. **Timeline**: Detailed view of temperature anomalies over time, with zoom functionality.
3. **Decades**: Comparison of average temperature anomalies by decade.
4. **Time Comparison**: Analysis of temperature changes across different 30-year periods.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of key findings and overall trends.
